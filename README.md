# Welcome to my Quantitative Finance Playground!

### Overview
This repository serves as a hub for listing my articles and experiments. I primarly focus on Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning.

I am currently studying Hasbrouck’s *Empirical Market Microstructure*, an interesting technical introduction on market making.

### About Me
Starting with a background in Physics and spending six years in finance, I've currently found my groove as a Quant.

When I'm not crunching numbers, I'm absorbed in the pages of a book or tending to my garden.

## Articles
Below are my articles, sorted by their most recent publication dates. Where applicable, I will provide links to Python notebooks containing the plots and computations used in each piece.

  *In this article, instead of focusing on the spread, we will illustrate the probability distribution of the volume of buy and sell orders. To this aim, we will first study the probability of having b buys given n trades under a Binomial distribution, then the probability of having b buys and s sells during a trading day under a Poisson distribution. This will allow us to estimate the fraction of informed agents in the market μ.*


- [**Sequential Trade Model for Asymmetrical Information — Part 2**](https://medium.com/technological-singularity/sequential-trade-model-for-asymmetrical-information-part-2-74ce13070bdd)

  -- Apr 2024 --

  *In this piece, I’ll extend my exploration into the Sequential Trade Model proposed by Hasbrouck in Chapter 5 of Empirical Market Microstructure. Moreover, I will solve the suggested exercises, offering my insights and discussing potential further developments.*

  [Notebook 2](https://github.com/Peropero0/quantitative_finance_playground/blob/main/notebooks/Hasbrouck_Market_Microstructure/sequential_trade_model_part_2.ipynb)

  *In this piece, I will further explore the Bid-Ask spread dynamics by assuming that the market is populated by two types of agents with two different sets of information: fully informed and completely uninformed traders. Fully informed traders already know the security’s end-of-day value, while uninformed traders don’t. To address this scenario, I will use a specific case of Glosten and Milgrom model, to analyse how different levels of information among market participants influence overall market activity and define trading strategies.*


- [**Relaxing Linear Regression assumptions — A Roll model application**](https://medium.com/@lu.battistoni/relaxing-linear-regression-assumptions-a-roll-model-application-59e310dde6ce)

  In the world of quantitative finance and data science, linear regression is widely used to explore the relation between variables. Being a simple and powerful tool, it’s easy to fall into the pitfall of using it without testing its basic assumptions. In this article, I will use the Exercises 4.2 and 4.3 of Hasbrouck’s Empirical Market Microstructure to show how violation of linear regression assumptions can impact parameter estimation of a Roll model. 


- [**The Roll Model Under Serial Dependence**](https://python.plainenglish.io/roll-model-under-serial-dependence-f9ba693446f9)

  -- Feb 2024 --

  [Notebook](https://github.com/Peropero0/quantitative_finance_playground/blob/main/notebooks/Hasbrouck_Market_Microstructure/roll_model_serial_dependence.ipynb)
  
  While approaching to univariate timeseries analysis, one could struggle with applying the mathematical theory to simple practical cases. In this article, I will use the Excercise 4.1 of Hasbrouck’s Empirical Market Microstructure to study the dynamics of an autoregressive toy model.
